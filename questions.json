This enables risk-based prioritization. While external systems (A) are often higher risk, some internal systems may be more critical. Compensating controls (C) should be based on risk prioritization.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Password spraying (B) is MOST likely - the pattern of few attempts per IP targeting one account is characteristic of spraying to avoid account lockouts. Brute force (A) typically has many attempts from fewer sources. Credential stuffing (C) uses known username/password pairs across multiple accounts. Dictionary attacks (D) try many passwords against one account from the same source. The distributed, low-volume attempts targeting one admin account is the key indicator of password spraying."

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Parameterized queries (B) are the BEST mitigation that can be implemented gradually with code changes limited to database interaction points. This provides robust protection. WAF (A) is good as a compensating control but can be bypassed and requires ongoing tuning. Input validation (C) requires changes throughout the application and can be incomplete. Least privilege (D) limits damage but doesn't prevent SQL injection. While B requires code changes, they're targeted and provide the strongest protection."

      "D": "Use Remote Desktop Gateway with MFA"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "ZTNA (C) is BEST because it provides least privilege access to specific applications, not the entire network, while continuously verifying trust. VPN (A) grants too much network access. Jump box (B) improves security but still provides broader access than needed. RD Gateway (D) is good for Windows environments but ZTNA provides more granular, application-level access control regardless of platform. ZTNA embodies zero-trust principles most effectively."

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Document and notify management FIRST (C) because the server is critical with active transactions. Management must decide between business continuity and containment. Immediate isolation (A) might be appropriate but could cause significant business impact requiring management approval. Imaging (B) and running AV (D) come after the initial assessment and management decision.

While MTTD/MTTR (B) are valuable operational metrics, translating security improvements to financial risk reduction and return on investment resonates with board members. Vulnerability counts (A) and training completion (C) are important metrics but don't directly communicate business value.

Brute force (A) typically has many attempts from fewer sources. Credential stuffing (C) uses known username/password pairs across multiple accounts. Dictionary attacks (D) try many passwords against one account from the same source. The distributed, low-volume attempts targeting one admin account is the key indicator of password spraying."

WAF (A) is good as a compensating control but can be bypassed and requires ongoing tuning. Input validation (C) requires changes throughout the application and can be incomplete.

VPN (A) grants too much network access. Jump box (B) improves security but still provides broader access than needed.

      "D": "Container security scanning and runtime protection"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Service mesh with mTLS and policy enforcement (B) is BEST for microservices as it provides identity-based authorization between services, encrypted communication, and fine-grained policy control. API gateway (A) manages external access but not service-to-service. Network segmentation (C) is too coarse-grained for dynamic microservices. Container scanning (D) addresses image security but not service communication. Service mesh is purpose-built for microservices security architecture."

    "question": "An organization identified that several employees are using the same password across multiple corporate applications. Which control would be MOST effective in preventing this practice?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Implement password complexity requirements",
      "B": "Deploy a password manager for all employees",
      "C": "Enable password history to prevent reuse",
      "D": "Implement single sign-on (SSO) across applications"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "SSO (D) is MOST effective because it eliminates the need for multiple passwords entirely - users authenticate once and access all applications. Password managers (B) help but rely on user adoption. Complexity requirements (A) don't prevent reuse across systems. Password history (C) prevents reuse within the same system but not across different systems. SSO addresses the root cause: too many passwords leading users to reuse them."

    "question": "A company's backup tapes are stored at an offsite facility. During a disaster recovery exercise, the team discovered that some backup tapes cannot be read. Which security control would have BEST prevented this issue?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Implement encryption for all backup tapes",
      "B": "Perform regular backup restoration testing",
      "C": "Use a different backup vendor",
      "D": "Store backups in multiple geographic locations"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Regular restoration testing (B) would have BEST prevented this by identifying unreadable tapes before an actual disaster. This is a core principle: backups aren't valid until proven restorable. Encryption (A) doesn't address readability. Different vendor (C) doesn't solve the testing problem. Multiple locations (D) improve availability but don't verify restore capability. The issue isn't where backups are stored but whether they can be restored - only testing validates this."

    "question": "After a major security incident, the board of directors asks for assurance that similar incidents will be prevented. Which approach would provide the MOST comprehensive risk reduction?",
    "choices": {
      "A": "Implement all recommendations from the incident report",
      "B": "Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment and update the security roadmap",
      "C": "Hire additional security staff to improve monitoring",
      "D": "Purchase additional security tools to close identified gaps"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Comprehensive risk assessment with updated roadmap (B) is MOST comprehensive as it identifies all risks, not just those related to one incident, and prioritizes mitigation based on overall organizational risk. Implementing incident recommendations (A) is reactive and may miss other critical risks. Additional staff (C) and tools (D) may help but should be based on a thorough risk assessment. Option B provides strategic, risk-based decision making rather than tactical responses."
